A web server running on http://localhost:80 should be set to serve images present on the 'store' folder. This folder provides as well some images present on the images folder for some products creation.

This application makes use of an api provided by the project store-api. This project can be cloned from the a github repository on https://github.com/Sofiagrm/store-api.git

Database script is provided to create a mysql database. For the purpose of usage with this application the script store_mysql_schema_creation_script.sql must be used to create a database, which must run on port 3306. This can be configured, as well as other DB configurations on the file db.config.js of the store-api project.

The site is launched via command line using node, running the commande npm start. Before this is convinient to to install the project (npm install).

To be able to have contents on the site, they need to be created. This can be done through the admin page of the site (http://localhost:3000/admin). You can add products and product categories. It is advisable to create categories previously to adding products as these require categories.

The basket (shopping cart), on the top right shows the number of products added to the cart. Clicking the number will direct you to the shopping cart page.

Unfortunatly, due to last moment code changes the addiction or subtraction of product amounts stopped refreshing the amount on screen, although the buttons works, there is no way to know the amount of product. Due to this there was no time to actually implement the functionality to store invoiceson the database with the pay button.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
